      <p className='mb-1'>The Site and Services are to facilitate the advertising, sale and rental of the User’s Product. You may only sell, lend, buy or rent Product if you are a registered user of the Site, however you may view listings of Product as an unregistered visitor to the Site and Services.</p>
      <p>Second Stage is not an owner or dealer of any Product, nor is it a provider of any Product and Second Stage does not own, sell, resell, provide, rent, re-rent, manage and/or control any Product, including courier or other delivery services. Second Stage has engaged the service of a courier company on behalf of its Users. However, Second Stage does not provide these Courier Services and accepts no liability for any damage or loss caused in any way through or by the Courier Service. It is a condition that the Courier Service will be used to deliver the Product to the buyer or renter and return the Product to the Lender if rented. If a User does not wish to use the Courier Service, they must not use the Site or Services.</p>
      <h5 className="mb-3 mt-4">SERVICE FEES</h5>
      <p className='mb-1'>In consideration for the use of Second Stage’s online marketplace and platform, Second Stage charges a flat rate of 10% per transaction for Service Fees to the Seller/Lender.

Where applicable, Taxes (such as VAT in Europe or GST in Australia) may also be charged in respect of any Fees, dependent upon the taxation status of the Seller/Lender. Second Stage deducts the Service Fees before remitting the balance to the Seller/Lender as described in these Terms. </p>
      <p className='mb-1'>

      </p>
      <p className='mb-1'>

If agreement has been reached, you must advise Second Stage to enable processing of any additional fees to be paid by the Renter, noting that a Service Fee will be deducted. In the event agreement cannot be reached between the Lender and the Renter, you as the Lender agree to lodge an issue with Second Stage within ten days of the completion of the Rental Period. The failure lodge an issue within the 10 days of the completion of the Rental Period, will result in the release of any approval or pre authorisation held on the Renter’s credit card and you acknowledge you will forfeit any claim against the Renter.

      <p className='mb-1'>
      If you, as a Renter, choose to enter into a transaction with a Lender for the rental of Product, you agree and understand that you will be required to enter into an agreement with the Lender and you agree to accept any terms, conditions, rules and restrictions associated with the rental of such Product as imposed by the Lender. You acknowledge and agree that you, and not Second Stage, will be responsible for performing the obligations of any such agreements, that Second Stage is not a party to such agreements, and that, with the exception of its payment obligations hereunder, Second Stage accepts no liability arising from or related to any agreements made between a Lender and a Renter. You acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding the fact that Second Stage is not a party to the agreement between you and the Lender, Second Stage acts as the Lender’s payment collection agent for the limited purpose of accepting payments from you on behalf of the Lender. Upon your payment of the Total Fees to Second Stage, your payment obligation to the Lender for the Total Fees is extinguished, and Second Stage is responsible for providing the Product Fees (less Second Stage’s Lender Fees and relevant Courier Fee), in the manner described in these Terms. In the event that Second Stage does not remit any such amounts as described in these Terms, such Lender will have recourse only against Second Stage. You acknowledge and agree that you will remain liable for any Late/Non-Return Fees or Damage Fees.
      </p>
      <p className='mb-1'>
      The Total Fees payable will be displayed on the Site and accessible by the Renter before a commitment is entered into, including disclosure of the maximum Replacement Value of the Product in the event of serious damage or late or non-return. A Renter will submit a Rental Request to the Lender and the Lender has the opportunity to accept or reject a Rental Request at which time the Rental Request will be approved and payment processed or rejected and the Rental Request will be cancelled at no cost to either the Renter or the Lender. A Rental Request will include the price, proposed rental period, Replacement Value and postage costs.  
Upon acceptance of a Rental Request, you agree to pay, via Second Stage, the Total Fees for any rental requested. You understand and agree that Second Stage, on behalf of the Lender, reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to:
      </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
      Obtain a pre-authorisation via your credit card for the Total Fees; or
      </li>
      <li>Charge your credit card a nominal amount, not to exceed one dollar ($1), or a similar sum in the currency in which you are transacting (e.g. one euro or one British pound), to verify your credit card;</li>
      <li>Obtain a pre-authorisation for the Replacement Value of the Product.</li>
     </ul>
     <p className='mb-1'>Once Second Stage receives confirmation of your rental from the applicable Lender, Second Stage will collect the Total Fees in accordance with these Terms and the pricing terms set forth in the applicable Listing. Please note that Second Stage cannot control any fees that may be charged to a Renter by his or her bank related to Second Stage’s collection of the Total Fees, and Second Stage disclaims all liability in this regard.</p>
     <p className='mb-1'>In connection with your requested rental, you will be asked to provide standard billing information such as name, billing address and credit card information either to Second Stage and/or its third-party payment processor. You agree to pay Second Stage for any confirmed rentals made in connection with your Second Stage Account in accordance with these Terms by one of the methods described on the Site or Application, e.g. by credit card. You hereby authorize the collection of such amounts by charging the credit card provided as part of requesting the rental, either directly by Second Stage or indirectly, via a third-party online payment processor or by one of the payment methods described on the Site or Application. </p>
     <p className='mb-1'>In relation to any approved Rental Request, you also authorize Second Stage to charge your credit card for damage caused to Product as contemplated under “Damage to Products” below or for late or non-return of any Product. The maximum value of any pre-authorisation to be held on or charged to your credit card will be equal to or less than the Replacement Value as nominated by the Lender and advised to the Renter prior to the submission of a Rental Request. This pre-authorisation or approval will be held until the Lender confirms return of the Product in good condition or ten days from the conclusion of the Rental Period, whichever is the earliest. If the Lender raises an ‘Issue’ with the transaction, the pre-authorisation or approval will be continued until the matter is resolved to the satisfaction of the Lender or in the case of an unreasonable delay of such approval, when Second Stage deems the matter to be closed with or without the need for such charges to be paid.</p>

      </li>
      <li>you and the Lender cannot come to an agreement within a period of 72 hours from the time you lodge a valid response to a claim and a determination by Second Stage, in its sole discretion, has been made and advised to both the Lender and the Renter.</li>

     <h5 className="mb-2 mt-4">ISSUES</h5>
     <h6 className='mb-3'>Late/Non-Return Fees</h6>
     <p className='mb-1'>
     All Users must comply with a standardized Late/Non-Return Fee Policy (Late Fees)that Second Stage will enforce to protect both Renter and Lender alike. Second Stage relies on both Lenders and Renters sending and returning Products in a timely manner.
     </p>
     <p className='mb-1'>
     If a Product is returned late (after the conclusion of the Rental Period) an additional $22 per day (including Service Fees) will be charged for each day the Product is not returned. Renters agree to this policy every time they request a booking. Late fees will be capped at 4 weeks up to a maximum of the Replacement Value as determined by the Lender and provided to the Renter prior to the submission of a Rental Request, unless otherwise determined by Second Stage in their sole discretion.
     </p>
     <p className='mb-1'>
     Second Stage also reserves the right to charge the credit card on file in the Renter’s Second Stage Account, or otherwise collect payment from the Renter and pursue any avenues available to Second Stage in this regard, in situations in which the Renter has been determined, in Second Stage’s sole discretion, to have returned Product late or failed to return Product to the Lender. If we are unable to charge the credit card on file or otherwise collect payment from the Renter, the Renter agrees to remit payment for the additional rental period to the applicable Lender or to Second Stage (if applicable). Unpaid invoices will be passed on to a debt-collection service with collection costs recoverable including additional service fees applicable.
     </p>
     <p className='mb-1'>
     Calculation of late fees starts from the completion of the Rental Period until the exact date the Product is collected by the nominated courier. A Renter will not be liable for late fees if the delay on the return is outside their control, such as unexpected delays by the Courier and can provide evidence to support their claim (confirmation of collection from the Courier and tracking information). 
     </p>
     <h5 className="mb-2 mt-4">Damage Fees</h5>
     <p className='mb-1'>
     All Users must comply with a standardized Damage Fee Policy that Second Stage will enforce to protect both Renter and Lender alike. Second Stage relies on both Lenders and Renters sending and returning Product in fit for purpose and clean condition.

     Disclaimers
     </h5>
     <h6>
     Limitation of Liability
     </h6>
     <p className='mb-1'>
     You acknowledge and agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by law, the entire risk arising out of your use of the Site, in whatever way you use it, remains with you. Neither Second Stage nor any third party involved in creating, producing, or delivering the Site will be liable for any incidental, special, exemplary or consequential damages, including lost profits, loss of data or loss of goodwill, service interruption, computer damage or system failure or the cost of substitute products or services, or for any damages for personal or bodily injury or emotional distress arising out of or in connection with these Terms, from the use of or inability to use the Site from any communications, interactions or meetings with other Users of the Site or other persons with whom you communicate or interact as a result of your use of the Site from your listing or rental of any product via the Site whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), product liability or any other legal theory, and whether or not Second Stage has been informed of the possibility of such damage, even if a limited remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose.
     </p>
     <p>
     Except for our obligations to pay amounts to applicable Sellers/Lenders pursuant to the Terms, in no event will Second Stage’s aggregate liability arising out of or in connection with the Terms and your use of the Site including, but not limited to, from your Listing or Sale or Rental of any Product via the Site or from the use of or inability to use the Site and in connection with any Product or interactions with any other Users, exceed the amounts you have paid/owe/received or are owed for purchases, sales or rentals via the Site as a Buyer/Seller/Lender or Renter in the twelve (12) month period prior to the event giving rise to the liability. The limitations of damages set forth above are fundamental elements of the basis of the bargain between Second Stage and the User. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the above limitation may not apply to you.
     </p>
     <h5 className="mb-3 mt-4">
     Indemnification
     </h5>
     <p>
     You agree to release, defend, indemnify, and hold Second Stage and its affiliates and subsidiaries, and their officers, directors, employees and agents, harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising out of or in any way connected with:
     </p>
     <ul>

      </li>
      <li>Your User Content; </li>
      <li>
      Your

        </li>

      </ol>
      </li>
      <li>The use, condition or rental of an Product by you, including but not limited to any injuries, losses, or damages (compensatory, direct, incidental, consequential or otherwise) of any kind arising in connection with or as a result of a rental, rental or use of an Product.</li>
     </ul>
     <h5 className="mb-3 mt-4">Entire Agreement</h5>
     <p>
     These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Second Stage and the User regarding the Site, Services, Collective Content, and any sales, rentals or Listings of Product made via the Site and the Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Second Stage and the User regarding sale, rentals or listings of Product, the Site, Services and Collective Content.
     </p>
     <h5 className="mb-3 mt-4">General</h5>
     <p>
     The failure of Second Stage to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorised representative of Second Stage. Except as expressly set forth in the Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under the Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under the Terms or otherwise. If for any reason an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of the Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be severable and all other provisions of the Terms will remain in full force and effect.
